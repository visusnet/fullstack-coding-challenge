# Fullstack Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge that I am participating in and it is not meant to be of interest to anyone else, even though it is public. I am not looking for feedback or pull requests. I am not looking for a job.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to create a RESTful API that allows explore GitHub repositories. The API should allow the user to view the most popular repositories created in the last 2 weeks. The user may be able to filter the repositories by programming language (bonus). Additional endpoints should allow the user to bookmark a repository locally and view the list of bookmarked repositories. Basic information about repositories like name, link to GitHub, description, number of stars should be made available through the API.

## Restrictions

- There should be no user interface.
- Bookmarks should be stored locally.

## Documentation

Major design decisions will be documented as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) in the `docs/adr` directory. The ADRs are numbered in the order they were created. The ADRs are written in Markdown and can be viewed on GitHub.
