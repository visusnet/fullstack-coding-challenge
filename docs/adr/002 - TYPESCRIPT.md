## ADR-002: Usage of TypeScript

### Context

The coding challenge, as outlined in the README.md, requires the creation of a RESTful API to explore GitHub repositories. Although there is no specific requirement for type-safety, TypeScript will be used for implementing the solution.

### Decision

TypeScript was chosen for implementing the coding challenge, despite the absence of a specified requirement for type-safety. This decision was made to leverage the benefits of TypeScript, such as improved code quality, better tooling support, and enhanced developer experience. Additionally, TypeScript's static type checking can help prevent potential runtime errors and improve code maintainability.

### Consequences

By using TypeScript, the implementation of the solution will benefit from enhanced code quality, improved tooling support, and a more robust developer experience. The utilization of TypeScript's static type checking will contribute to reducing potential runtime errors and enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.
