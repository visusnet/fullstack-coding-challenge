## ADR-004: Deletion of Bookmarks

### Context

There is no requirement to unmark repositories, and therefore no deletion of bookmarks will be implemented.

### Decision

No deletion of bookmarks will be implemented due to the absence of a requirement to unmark repositories.

### Consequences

The absence of a deletion feature will simplify the implementation and reduce the complexity of the system.
