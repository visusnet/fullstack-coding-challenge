## ADR-005: No Security Mechanisms for Simplified Coding Challenge

### Context

This ADR is being written to document the decision not to implement any security mechanisms such as authentication or authorization for the simplified coding challenge. As outlined in the README.md, the challenge is focused on creating a simple RESTful API to explore GitHub repositories, with no user interface and local storage for bookmarks. Since the coding challenge is simplified and there are no specific requirements regarding security, it has been decided not to introduce any security mechanisms.

### Decision

Given the nature of the coding challenge and its focus on simplicity, it has been decided that no security mechanisms such as authentication or authorization will be implemented. This decision is based on the understanding that the challenge does not require user authentication or authorization, and the primary goal is to create a lightweight and straightforward solution for exploring GitHub repositories.

### Consequences

By not implementing security mechanisms, the solution will remain lightweight and focused on the core functionality of the API. This choice will help in keeping the implementation simple and accessible to other developers without the need for additional security-related complexity. However, it is important to note that in a real-world scenario, security considerations would be essential, but for the purpose of this coding challenge, the decision to omit security mechanisms aligns with the goal of simplicity and minimalism.
